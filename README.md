# affordability-calculator

Estimate the income required for a particular home by inputting the various parameters (mortgage rate, downpayment, loan term, etc.). Then
based on the qualifying DTI (Debt-to-Income) chosen, a required salary will be calculated.

Selecting the MSA associated with the home calculates the percentage of a given MSAs population would be able to qualify for a loan to buy this home.

Additionally, you can adjust the loan parameter to better understand the sensitivity to various parameters such as interest rates.
